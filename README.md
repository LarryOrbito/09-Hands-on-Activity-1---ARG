# Hands-on Activity: Quadrilateral Shapes

## Objective
The objective of this activity is to create a Java program that demonstrates inheritance and method overriding in object-oriented programming. By the end of this activity, students will be able to:
- Override methods in a superclass.
- Understand class inheritance and polymorphism.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following Java classes:
- `Quadrilateral`: The base class representing a generic quadrilateral shape.
- `Rectangle`: A subclass of `Quadrilateral` that represents a rectangle.
- `Square`: A subclass of `Rectangle` that represents a square.
- `Parallelogram`: A subclass of `Quadrilateral` that represents a parallelogram.
- `Rhombus`: A subclass of `Parallelogram` that represents a rhombus.
- `Trapezoid`: A subclass of `Quadrilateral` that represents a trapezoid.
- `RunQuad`: The main class that contains the `main` method to run the program.

## Software Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- An IDE or text editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans, or Visual Studio with Java support)

## Setup Instructions
1. **Install JDK**: Download and install the latest version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
2. **Set Up IDE**: Open your preferred IDE and create a new Java project.
3. **Create Java Classes**: Create the following Java files in your project:
   - `Quadrilateral.java`
   - `Rectangle.java`
   - `Square.java`
   - `Parallelogram.java`
   - `Rhombus.java`
   - `Trapezoid.java`
   - `RunQuad.java`
4. **Copy Code**: Copy the provided code for each class into the corresponding Java files.

## Running the Program
1. Open the `RunQuad.java` file in your IDE.
2. Compile the project to ensure there are no errors.
3. Run the `RunQuad` class. The console will prompt you to enter a character:
   - Press `R` for Rectangle
   - Press `S` for Square
   - Press `P` for Parallelogram
   - Press `H` for Rhombus
   - Press `T` for Trapezoid
4. The program will display the appropriate description based on your choice.

## Sample Output
## Grading Rubric
The project will be graded based on the following criteria:
- **Correctness (40 points)**: The code produces the expected result.
- **Logic (40 points)**: The code meets the specifications of the problem.
- **Efficiency (10 points)**: The code is concise without sacrificing correctness and logic.
- **Syntax (10 points)**: The code adheres to the rules of the programming language.

## Additional Information
- Keep a copy of your program, as you will be using it for future activities.
- Feel free to modify the code and experiment with additional shapes or descriptions.
